## Projects
### Strain Classification of Fission Yeast using Machine Learning
_Set to be published soon_

Spearheaded a scientific article focusing on the application of data science and machine learning to classify strains of fission yeast, covering both control and mutant strains. Managed tasks such as data cleaning, strain selection, and hyperparameter tuning using **Python**. The methodology included processing microscopy movies, extracting various features, and evaluating machine learning models. The Random Forest model excelled in binary classification, leading to its selection for multiclass classification. The project achieved over 75% accuracy in categorizing strains and underwent successful testing with new data. Contributed to drafting the scientific article, emphasizing methodology, results, and discussion. The ultimate goal is to translate this methodology for broader applications in different experimental models and labs.

### Enhancing Lab Protocols with a GUI
[Jupyer Notebook]

_Set to be published soon_

Played a pivotal role in translating **R** scripts to **Python**, utilizing tkinter to create a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that offered diverse approaches, significantly improving the user-friendliness of the lab protocols and streamlining the methology. Further contributed to writing the methodology, results, and figures for a book chapter on computational methods. The outcome was a more accessible and efficient protocol, showcasing the fusion of technical translation and scientific communication to advance computational capabilities in the lab.

### Python Script for EEG Data Processing and Visualization
[Jupyer Notebook]

Developed a versatile **Python** script featuring distinct functions designed to seamlessly import, preprocess, apply a Savitzky-Golay filter, compute errors, and generate visualizations from **Excel** data. The primary objective was to produce a relative power (EEG) plot with smoothing. The protocol is acknowledged in a [published research paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378874122005311?via%3Dihub).

###  Exploratory Data Analysis and Prediction of Lego Set Trends
[Jupyer Notebook]

Conducted a comprehensive analysis of Lego sets spanning from 1950 to 2017 utilizing **Python**. The process encompassed data exploration, cleaning, visualization, and analytical tasks. Specific analyses included determining the percentage of licensed sets, identifying the most popular sets by year, assessing the number of unique sets, and calculating the average number of blocks released annually. The project culminated in the implementation of a polynomial regression model to predict the number of unique sets and average blocks expected for the years 2018-2030.
